CourseSearch
============

The basic idea is as follows:

User wants to learn some certain knowledge, but they don't know what online course they should watch to get that knowledge.

Instead of blindly searching on the internet, this program enables them to just type in the key word of the knowledge that they 
want to learn, and they will get a ranked list of online courses kind of like when you are searching with Google.

The interesting part of this search algorithm is that, it will not only consider merely the input keyword. Furthermore, it will
try to "guess" what you actually want by looking for related key words, assigning weights based on various factors and so on to 
make sure that the user will get the most relevant course that they want to study.
